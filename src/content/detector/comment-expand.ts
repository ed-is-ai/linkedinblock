/**
 * Safe comment-expansion helper.
 *
 * Clicks the LinkedIn "View comments" / "Load more comments" button on a post node
 * to expose comment text for the generic-comments engagement signal (DETECT-07).
 *
 * Design constraints (D-02, RESEARCH Open Question 2):
 *   - Read-only action: only the comment-expand button is clicked. Block, like, follow,
 *     and send buttons are NEVER touched (CLAUDE.md constraint #3 / T-02-11).
 *   - Page-scoped expansion budget: MAX_EXPANSIONS_PER_PAGE caps the total number of
 *     comment-expand clicks across the entire page load at 10. This prevents the
 *     extension from making excessive requests to LinkedIn's comment API when many
 *     suspicious posts appear in a single feed session (RESEARCH Open Question 2).
 *   - Silent degrade: if the expand button is absent (post has no comments or already
 *     expanded), the function returns [] immediately without throwing (Pitfall 2).
 *   - Error safety: the entire function body is wrapped in try/catch. Clicking a stale
 *     or detached node must not throw uncaught errors to the caller.
 *
 * SPA navigation note:
 *   Call resetExpansionBudget() from the SPA navigation hook in content/index.ts (Plan 04)
 *   whenever the user navigates to a new feed view. This ensures each new feed page starts
 *   with a fresh 10-expansion budget rather than carrying over state from the previous page.
