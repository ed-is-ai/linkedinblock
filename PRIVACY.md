# Privacy Policy — LinkedIn Blocker

**Last updated:** 2026-05-30

LinkedIn Blocker is a Chrome extension that detects and hides AI-generated posts in your LinkedIn feed. This policy explains what data the extension stores, where it is stored, and how you can delete it.

---

## What data is stored

All data is stored **locally on your device** using `chrome.storage.local`. Nothing is transmitted to any server unless you explicitly enable the optional AI-powered detection feature described below.

| Data | Purpose | Stored where |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Flagged account records (profile ID, name, URL, detection scores, signal breakdown) | Powers the popup review queue | `chrome.storage.local` |
| Stored post text (up to 1000 characters per post, max 200 posts) | Lets you review what was hidden | `chrome.storage.local` |
| Daily statistics (post counts, unique author IDs seen per day) | Powers the dashboard feed-health stats | `chrome.storage.local` |
| Dismissed account IDs | Prevents re-flagging accounts you've cleared | `chrome.storage.local` |
| Anthropic API key (optional) | Required only for the optional AI-powered detection mode | `chrome.storage.local` |

---

## LinkedIn data access

The extension reads your LinkedIn feed page (`linkedin.com`) to extract post text and author information for local scoring. It does **not** access your LinkedIn account credentials, messages, connections, or profile settings.

---

## Optional AI-powered detection (opt-in)

By default the extension uses only local heuristic rules — **no data leaves your device**.

If you choose to enable AI-powered detection, you must manually set an Anthropic API key by running the following command in Chrome DevTools:

```
chrome.storage.local.set({ anthropicApiKey: 'sk-ant-...' })
```

When an API key is set, post text is sent to **Anthropic's API** (`api.anthropic.com`) for analysis. This data is subject to [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy). You can remove the key at any time with:

```
chrome.storage.local.remove('anthropicApiKey')
```

---

## How to delete your data

### From the dashboard

Open the extension dashboard (click the extension icon → ⚙ Settings → View Dashboard, or navigate to the extension's options page). Use the **"Cleanse data before"** date control to remove records older than a chosen date, or set the date to tomorrow to remove everything.

### By uninstalling

Uninstalling the extension from Chrome removes all `chrome.storage.local` data automatically.

---

## Third-party services

| Service | When used | Policy |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Anthropic API (`api.anthropic.com`) | Only when user has set an API key (opt-in) | [anthropic.com/privacy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy) |

No analytics, crash reporting, or advertising services are used.

## Changes to this policy

If the data practices change in a future version, this file will be updated and the **Last updated** date will change. The policy is versioned alongside the extension source code on GitHub.
