## Milestone: v5.0 — Voice Pattern Detection

**Shipped:** 2026-05-31
**Phases:** 1 | **Plans:** 4

### What Was Built

- `checkHookStory` (0–20 pts): first-person anecdote opener patterns
- `checkMotivational` (0–15 pts): inspirational punch-rhythm paragraph detection
- `checkImpersonalVoice` (0–12 pts): generic third-person authority framing
- All three wired into `HeuristicDetector`; AI voice post scores 61

### What Worked

- Parallel Wave 1 (3 signal files, no cross-plan conflicts) kept execution fast
- Unit-first approach: signal functions tested in isolation before wiring
- The integration test (AI voice post ≥ 60) served as the natural acceptance criterion and caught a regex precision issue before the wave was closed

### What Was Inefficient

- The hook-story test text ("I was in a meeting") didn't trigger the regex — required iteration on the test post content rather than the implementation. More representative test content upfront would have avoided this round-trip.

### Patterns Established

- Signal scoring cap pattern: each signal has a hard max to prevent a single signal from dominating the composite score
- Progressive-form regex for first-person detection: `I was \w+ing` is more precise than `I was \w+` for distinguishing anecdote openers from meeting references

### Key Lessons

- When writing regex-based signal detectors, test against multiple negative examples (not just positive) before committing — "I was in a meeting" and "I was sitting" look identical at a glance but differ critically
- Small scope milestones (1 phase, 4 plans) don't need a formal audit; the integration test IS the audit

### Cost Observations

- Single-day execution
- 4 plans, parallel wave structure kept context lean

## Milestone: v4.0 — Prompt Caching

**Shipped:** 2026-05-31
**Phases:** 1 | **Plans:** 1

### What Was Built

- Anthropic prompt caching header (`anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31`)
- `system` field converted to array with `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }`
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT` expanded from ~200 to 856 words to meet Sonnet ≥ 1024 token minimum

### What Worked

- Single-plan phase is efficient for well-scoped API changes
- Expanding the system prompt to meet the token minimum was a design forcing function — produced a more thorough detection guide as a side effect

### Key Lessons

- Anthropic's 1024-token minimum for cache eligibility applies per-model-family; always check the docs when adding caching to a new model tier
- Cache_control goes on the system array entry, not at the message level

## Milestone: v3.0 — Repo Rename Cleanup

**Shipped:** 2026-05-31
**Phases:** 1 | **Plans:** 1

### What Was Built

- 11-file URL sweep replacing `linkedinblock` → `linkedinaivoiceblock`
- Git remote URL updated
- ZIP rebuilt with corrected internal URLs

### Key Lessons

- Repo rename should happen before CWS submission; do it before publishing any store links
- `git grep` is the fastest way to find stale URL references across a project

---

## Milestone: v2.0 — Chrome Web Store Release

**Shipped:** 2026-05-31
**Phases:** 3 (12–14) | **Plans:** 6

### What Was Built

- PNG icons at 16/48/128px with correct Vite `publicDir` wiring
- `manifest.json` v1.2.0 with all CWS-required fields
- `PRIVACY.md` and `store/LISTING.md` store assets
- `npm run package` → 27.6 KB ZIP
- `store/SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md`

### What Worked

- Separating packaging script from store assets into two phases kept each plan focused
- Vite's `root: 'src'` + `publicDir` pattern worked cleanly once understood

### Key Lessons

- Icons must live in `src/public/icons/` (not `public/icons/`) because Vite's root is set to `src/`
- CWS short description hard limit is 132 characters — write this first, it constrains the long description

## Milestone: v1.2 — Feed Insights & Export Completeness

**Shipped:** 2026-05-30
**Phases:** 2 (10–11) | **Plans:** 4

### What Was Built

- `dailyStats.seenProfileIds` unique author tracking
- Dashboard "Profile bot rate" stat
- Posts CSV export

### Key Lessons

- Tracking unique profiles per day requires a Set in daily stats, not just counts — the data model needs to be designed before the UI

---

## Milestone: v1.1 — UX & Data

**Shipped:** 2026-05-30
**Phases:** 3 (7–9) | **Plans:** 6

### What Was Built

- Post storage (200-cap, 1000-char truncation, URN dedup)
- Accordion signal detail panel in popup
- JSON/CSV export and date-based cleanse

### What Worked

- Post storage as a standalone phase (Phase 7) before the UI phase (Phase 8) made the popup detail work straightforward — data was ready

### Key Lessons

- Export and cleanse naturally belong in the same phase (Phase 9) since they share the same data access patterns
- Accordion accordion state (one open at a time) is simpler with a single `expandedId: string | null` state than per-row booleans

---

## Milestone: v1.0 — Clean Feed

**Shipped:** 2026-05-30
**Phases:** 6 (1–6) | **Plans:** 18

### What Was Built

- Full v1 feature set: MutationObserver, heuristic scoring, flagged account queue, popup UI, block/dismiss actions, threshold config, feed health dashboard

### What Worked

- DOM inspection prerequisite (Phase 1, plan 02) as an explicit plan step prevented guessing at selectors
- Pluggable Detector interface designed in Phase 2 — no rewrite needed to add LLM later
- Wave-based plan structure (parallel where no file conflicts, sequential where blocked) kept execution efficient

### What Was Inefficient

- LinkedIn DOM selector research took multiple rounds; a real browser session would have been faster

### Patterns Established

- Selector registry pattern (all selectors in one file) — single-file fix when LinkedIn redeploys
- CSS hiding with `.llb-hidden { display: none !important }` — never `element.remove()` to protect React's vDOM
- EMA rolling score on the account queue — avoids outlier inflation from single anomalous posts

### Key Lessons

- LinkedIn rebuilds CSS class names on every deploy; `data-*` attributes and `aria-label` are the only stable hooks
- Service worker terminates after ~30s idle; all state must be in `chrome.storage.local` immediately on change
- Never simulate clicks on LinkedIn UI; ToS risk — always use deep links

## Cross-Milestone Trends

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Days | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| v1.0 | 6 | 18 | 5 | Core feature set, most complex milestone |
| v1.1 | 3 | 6 | 1 | UX polish on top of solid foundation |
| v1.2 | 2 | 4 | 1 | Incremental dashboard features |
| v2.0 | 3 | 6 | 1 | CWS packaging and assets |
| v3.0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Maintenance/rename |
| v4.0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Performance optimization |
| v5.0 | 1 | 4 | 1 | Detection capability expansion |

**Recurring pattern:** Each milestone after v1.0 has been a focused single-day effort on one concern. The v1.0 foundation investment paid off — every subsequent milestone has been additive with minimal rework.

**Recurring lesson:** Test content quality matters as much as implementation quality for regex-based detectors. Write both positive and negative examples before finalising patterns.
