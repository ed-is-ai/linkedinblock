### 🚧 v7.0 Adaptive DOM Scraper (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Make LinkedIn scraping resilient to DOM/class churn — store selectors as a dynamic ranked candidate registry and add a self-healing adapter that detects breakage and re-derives working selectors automatically.

- [ ] **Phase 22: Externalize Selectors to Storage** - Storage-backed ranked candidate registry seeded from selectors.ts; runtime resolution via SelectorRegistry; zero behavior change (Wave 1)
- [ ] **Phase 23: Self-Healing Selector Adapter** - Breakage detection with 6 false-positive guards; heuristic re-derivation; LLM fallback on sanitized structural DOM; confidence-ranked candidates (Wave 2)

## Phase Details

### Phase 18: Popup Interaction Fixes

**Goal**: Posts from accounts at or above the block threshold are hidden in the feed, and popup interaction behaves correctly — account names link to LinkedIn profiles, Block marks accounts locally without navigation, and already-blocked accounts are visually distinguished
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Requirements**: BUG-01, POPUP-01, POPUP-02, POPUP-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Loading a LinkedIn feed page hides posts from any account whose stored score meets or exceeds the configured threshold (verified with a known flagged account)
  2. New posts injected by the SPA (infinite scroll) from threshold-hitting accounts are also hidden by the MutationObserver handler
  3. Clicking an account name row in the popup opens that account's LinkedIn profile URL in a new browser tab
  4. Clicking Block on a popup account row stores the account as blocked in chrome.storage.local without opening any LinkedIn page
  5. A popup account row whose account is already in blocked storage shows a visually distinct state (greyed out label or "Blocked" indicator) instead of an active Block button**Plans**: 3 plans

**Wave 1**

- [x] 18-01-PLAN.md — BUG-01: thresholdAuthors map + observer hide branch + settings rebuild
- [x] 18-02-PLAN.md — POPUP-01/POPUP-02: anchor stopPropagation + remove window.open from handleBlock

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 18-03-PLAN.md — POPUP-03: collapsible Blocked section + AccountRow isBlocked variant

**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 18.1: Dashboard Data Display (INSERTED)

**Goal:** The dashboard presents feed-health data visually — flagged-post rate and bot-profile rate render as horizontal bar rows, a "Net AI voice posts in feed" line chart shows the daily clean-feed percentage, and the redundant signal-categories card is removed — with a build-clean codebase and no throwaway artifacts.
**Requirements**: DASH-DISPLAY-01
**Depends on:** Phase 18
**Plans:** 1 plan
Plans:

- [x] 18.1-01-PLAN.md — Fix dashboard TS error, delete mockup file, human-verify visual display changes

### Phase 20: Batch Block

**Goal**: The user can mark all flagged accounts at or above the detection threshold as blocked in a single popup action, with a confirmation step showing the affected count before any change is committed
**Depends on**: Phase 18.1
**Requirements**: BATCH-01, BATCH-02, BATCH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. The popup displays a "Block all above threshold" button (or equivalent action) when at least one flagged account's peak score meets or exceeds the configured threshold
  2. Activating the action shows a confirmation prompt that states how many accounts will be blocked before any write occurs
  3. Confirming the action writes all qualifying accounts to blocked storage; cancelling leaves storage unchanged
  4. After confirmation, previously-qualifying popup rows show the already-blocked visual state from Phase 18

**Plans**: 1 planPlans:

- [x] 20-01-PLAN.md — Batch-block popup action: BatchBlockBar + handleBatchBlock single-set write + inline confirmation (BATCH-01/02/03)

**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 21: Dashboard Button Reposition

**Goal**: The "View Dashboard" button is visible at the top of the popup without any interaction, making the dashboard immediately discoverable
**Depends on**: Phase 20
**Requirements**: POPUP-04, POPUP-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. Opening the popup shows a "View Dashboard" control in the header region, above the pending account list, without the user needing to open Settings
  2. Clicking that top-of-popup button opens dashboard/index.html in a new tab (same behavior as before, new position)
  3. Opening the Settings disclosure no longer contains a "View Dashboard" button — only the threshold slider, export controls, and API key section remain
  4. The change is confined to src/popup/index.tsx; no other files are modified

**Plans**: 1 planPlans:

- [x] 21-01-PLAN.md — Relocate View Dashboard button to popup header region; remove in-settings copy (POPUP-04, POPUP-05)

**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 22: Externalize Selectors to Storage

**Goal**: All selector lookups at runtime route through a new SelectorRegistry module backed by chrome.storage.local, seeded once from selectors.ts defaults, with versioned migration, 30-day TTL on adapted candidates, a reset-to-defaults escape hatch, a read-only health view, and cross-tab cache refresh — while the extension behaves identically to v6.1 from a user perspective
**Depends on**: Phase 21
**Requirements**: SELECTOR-01, SELECTOR-02, SELECTOR-03, SELECTOR-04, SELECTOR-05, SELECTOR-06, SELECTOR-07, SELECTOR-08, SELECTOR-09, SELECTOR-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Selectors are resolved from storage at runtime, not imported directly from selectors.ts — observer.ts and exclusions.ts contain no direct selector string imports
  2. The extension behaves identically to v6.1 on a live LinkedIn feed: the same posts are hidden, the same accounts are flagged, and no new console errors appear (regression-safe)
  3. A winning selector match rotates its candidate to position 0 in its list and the change persists across page reloads
  4. Opening the popup or dashboard shows a read-only selector health view listing each target's active selector, source badge (seed/heuristic/llm), and a warning when a critical selector has not matched recently
  5. Triggering "Reset to defaults" from the popup/dashboard restores all registry entries to the selectors.ts seed values and the health view reflects the change immediately
**Plans**: TBD

**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 23: Self-Healing Selector Adapter

**Goal**: The extension detects when selector scraping has broken on an active LinkedIn feed and automatically re-derives working candidates — first via structural heuristics, then via an LLM fallback — with strict validation before any candidate is written, rate-bounding on LLM calls, and full privacy protection
**Depends on**: Phase 22
**Requirements**: ADAPT-01, ADAPT-02, ADAPT-03, ADAPT-04, ADAPT-05, ADAPT-06, ADAPT-07, ADAPT-08, ADAPT-09, ADAPT-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Breakage detection does not trigger on a logged-out LinkedIn page, a skeleton-loader state, a non-feed URL, or a genuinely empty feed — all 6 false-positive guards (URL gate, container present, minimum session activity, no-posts placeholder, auth check, 30s rolling debounce) are verified by fixture tests
  2. When total breakage is detected on an active feed, the heuristic re-deriver proposes candidates locally without any API call; no candidate is written to storage until it passes the full validation gate (minimum match count, author-link ratio, post-text presence, sponsored-contamination rejection, feed-context containment)
  3. No post content, user names, headlines, photo URLs, or any PII leaves the browser during the LLM fallback — only a structural DOM skeleton with all text/href/src/aria-label stripped is sent to the Anthropic API
  4. LLM fallback is only reached when heuristics produce no valid candidate and an API key is configured; it is rate-bounded by a single-flight latch, a minimum 5-minute cool-off persisted across service-worker restarts, and a per-day hard cap
  5. The LLM response is strictly validated before use: selectors matching body/html/* are rejected, overly-broad selectors (outside a 2–50 match range) are rejected, and the selector string is never passed to eval
**Plans**: TBD
**Note — open decision (resolve at plan time):** LLM call location is now confirmed: the Anthropic fetch must live in the **service worker** (background/index.ts) because CORS blocks content-script direct fetches from linkedin.com. The existing LLMDetector pattern (content script sends SCORE_POST message → service worker fetches and responds) must be replicated for LLMRederiver. This is a code-verified fact from src/content/detector/llm.ts and src/background/index.ts.

**UI hint**: yes
